### What
Learning cpp: tic tac toe without AI, practicing C++ STL, google test, cmake, and GitHub Actions.



### GitHub Actions

#### To-do: 
* fix CTest output for Windows Latest MSVC (only one workflow which fails: ctest configuration required)

#### Compiled output (executable) actually manually verified: 
* ubuntu_gcc.7z (on Debian WSL)
